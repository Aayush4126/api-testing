# API Testing with TestNG and RestAssured

## Project Setup
- Java project using Maven
- Dependencies: TestNG (7.4.0), RestAssured (4.4.0)

## How to Run
- Right-click `testng.xml` → Run As → TestNG Suite

## Temporary Solution
- Basic GET request test created to check status code.

## Technical Debt
- POST request test lacks error handling.
- Future improvements:
  - Better validation
  - Data-driven tests

## Known Issues
- POST test might fail under high load (documented for future).
